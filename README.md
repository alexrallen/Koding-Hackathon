Koding-Hackathon
================

Our hackathon submission to solve to problem of fine print reading. This is an elegant solution to a problem that has troubled the legal and technical industry for years. This solution is simple and easy for any business to implement and garuntees additional consumer understanding of the EULA as it literally puts the main points in giant words in front of their face that cannot be ignored. This code shows a small red sidebar that parses the EULA into its main points and shows them as you go down the screen. Instead of seeing a blur of small text the customer gets to see the most important things about what he or she is agreeing to.
